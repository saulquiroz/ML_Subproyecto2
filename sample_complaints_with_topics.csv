"I lost my credit card ( a Chase Sapphire Reserve ) between the late night of XX/XX/2020 to the early morning of XX/XX/2020. I made one purchase during that time at XXXX XXXX XXXX with the amount of {$19.00}. I called Chase as soon as I found out my card was lost, which is on XX/XX/2020, and also realized that a fraud charge of {$43.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was posted to my account on XX/XX/2020. So, I informed Chase that it was unauthorized and they helped me to take that off my statement. 
However, I received a letter in early XXXX that I am responsible for the transaction. According to the single sheet letter that Chase sent me, "" I received benefit from this transaction ''. There are no proofs that I was using the card for that transaction and they do not even bother to ask the store for a signed copy of the receipt or things like security surveillance that can prove who was using the card. I have disputed other transactions before, but other agents took it seriously and sent me stuffs like signed receipts to back up the claim. 
I called Chase again on XX/XX/2020, a nice lady picked up the phone and said will pass my concern to the fraud department and let them re-investigate. However, two weeks passed and no responses were heard. 
I am so disappointed how Chase is treating one of their loyal customers and taking money from the good guys instead of the frauds.",Fraud Claims
"In 2005, I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They directed me to Bank One JP Morgan Chase for private student loans.

The monthly payments for these loans is {$410.00} each, for a total of {$1200.00} per month. My income, after taxes, was around XXXX per month. The debt to income ratio would have been 77 % not including paying for a roof over my head and other necessities.

As a result I, of course, defaulted on the loans. They have been turned over to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a debt collection agency, that took me to court without informing me and got a default judgment in XXXX County, WA for a debt now for over {$150000.00}.

With Chase a {$620.00} charge ( XXXX 2015 ) was originally disputed due to an obscure merchant name and the monies reapplied to the merchant who uses XXXX account. Chase then send us a our statement which was paid the full amount in XXXX. The merchant is indicating that XXXX is saying they have not been given the money.

"My issues is with JP Morgan Chase. On XX/XX/XXXX there was an automatic deposit made into my personal checking account in the amount of {$640.00}. However, this ACH deposit did not belong to me. After doing my own research of the description provided about the deposit, it was an unemployment payment from Colorado. I live in Indiana though! This ACH transaction was the beginning of all my issues. 
After those funds were deposited into my account, the account was flagged as fraud. Being that these funds were government issued I can understand that happening. But, what happened after and since leaves me in utter dismay of such a company. 
The company CLOSED ( NOT SUSPENDED ) my account. They then WITHDREW ( NOT FROZE ) all the funds in my account. This all took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 
After the company WITHDREW all my funds, there were 3 transactions that I had previously made that posted. This then put my account in the negative of {$180.00}. 
I spoke with the Fraud Department several times over the courseof the next 1.5 weeks, due to being hung up on and customer service reps not knowing how to help me or giving me conflicting information from one person to the next. This was to try and determine how I can resolve any issues and have the money that belonged to me returned. 
It was determined that I needed to provide documents of all my funds that were put into my account dating from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This was to PROVE what amount of the previously WITHDRAWN money truly belonged to me. 
I gathered all necessary documents and had the scanned into my file or the system at my local branch office. 
This process was repeated 2 times because after a month of repeatedly calling to check the progress, I was told these documents never made it to where they needed to be. 
In XXXX I was speaking to a Claims Department representative who informed me that my previous fraud claim against the {$640.00} ( I was told previously I needed to file a Fraud Claim on this transaction in order to show it wasn't mine ) had never been processed. The previous claim was done the month before! So, I filed a new fraud claim against the transaction. This was done on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter with in days stating that this claim needed no action and the inquiry was resolved. Yet, no matter who I tried to talk to in any Department no one could tell me how the funds that belonged to me could be released. 
I also had been receiving collection letters and phone calls by this time over the negative balance on my account. But remember, it was only negative because the company WITHDREW all my money. 
So, I would not pay off the account. That money and those funds the Collection Department was seeking was being held by the company already. 
Finally I received help by a banker at my local branch who was acting as a liaison for me. He tried very hard to figure out how to fix this issue, even though he couldn't fix it himself. 
In early XXXX, he was told by a representative in the Claims Department that although I recieved a letter from them stating the inquiry was resolved, that only meant that it was resolved on my end ... that there was nothing else for ME to do. But that THEY had 90 days from the date of inquiry to release any funds belonging to me, as they may need to look into the claim further. ( WHAT! ) OK, so I waited until XXXX XXXX. I never heard from anyone and never received a refund. 
I then went to see that same banker. After being shifted through different departments on the phone with him there, we ended up speaking to the Fraud Department. They then stated that the Claims Department had not made the proper notes transfered into the system to the Fraud Department in order to give them permission to release my money. Their suggestion was to call Claims and tell them that I needed a 3 way call with myself, a Claims Representative, and a Fraud Representative all together in order to clear up any issues and finally get closure on this. 
I tried for 1.5 weeks with no results. The last Claims Department Manager I spoke to was on XX/XX/XXXX. This call ended with him being told by the Fraud Department that I needed to contact the Collections Department and resolve that issue now before they will look into how to release the money still owed to me from XX/XX/XXXX. As I've noted previously, those funds the Collections Department is after is being held by the company themselves. I have no intention on giving them more money! 

At this point I feel that I have done everything asked of me. Called everyone I can and gone in person to speak with whom ever I could about this issue. 
Reporting this claim is the next step at this point.",Fraud Claims
"On XX/XX/XXXX there was a cash withdrawal of {$6000.00} made from my business account. I did not make the withdrawal and it's obviously someone within the bank branch that did. I have emails placing me at my work at that time, the IP address on the emails line up with my work router. Also the handwriting on the withdrawal slip is not mine. 
I attempted to deal with CHASE on this, after over a month of consideration they are declining to pay me. My accountants did not discover this until mid XXXX of XXXX, Chase is saying it was too late to do anything about it.

"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I experienced fraudulent activity on my personal checking account and had to close the account and open a new account. During this time, I had to contact all of my creditors and inform them of the new account information and setup auto-drafts all over again. Chase Bank was one of these creditors. I did not make any changes to my auto-draft with Chase Bank `` Freedom Card '' because it did not have a balance and no amounts were being auto-drafted at the time. Sometime in XXXX, Chase Bank enrolled me in "" paperless statements '' without my consent or permission. I have never opted into paperless statements because in past experiences, the email that I received about my new statement would end up in the "" spam folder '' of my email. In XXXX of XXXX I used my Chase Freedom Card for a series of purchases totaling around {$550.00}. I was under the assumption that the auto-draft was still in place and that a statement would come in the mail, but it never auto-drafted and a statement never came. Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Chase Bank informing me that my credit card account was more than 40 days past due. I immediately made a payment to clear the matter up. I then began investigating how this happened and why. I found out, after speaking with Chase Bank 's Executive Team that my account was enrolled in paperless statements and that my auto-draft had been cancelled by "" CHASE BANK ''. I did not cancel the auto-draft, Chase Bank cancelled it. Not only did they cancel it, but the communication that it had been cancelled was sent via email due to the paperless statements that I was incorrectly enrolled in by Chase Bank. Chase informed me that I signed up for paperless statements, however I did no such thing. I informed Chase Bank of this and they simply ignored it. They also ignored the fact that they cancelled the auto-draft, not me. After completing some research, I found out that Chase Bank incorporates a pop-up window on their website for my credit card account. On this pop-up, you must hit the "" continue '' button. Before hitting the continue button, I noticed that there is a "" check box '' that is already checked before you hit continue. What this means is that Chase Bank is forcing consumers to agree to paperless statements, without the consumer knowing because this "" check box '' is already "" PRE-CHECKED ''. What this means is that the consumer must first look closely to see that the box is already checked and they must "" un-check '' the box before hitting the "" continue '' button. This is a major issue and will likely lead to a Large Class Action Lawsuit against Chase Bank. If I can not get this issue resolved with Chase Bank, I will be the one that initiates this Class Action Lawsuit. After bringing light of all of this to Chase Bank, they continue to refuse to acknowledge this issue and refuse to correct my credit bureau report. I have been utilizing credit since I was XXXX XXXX XXXX and in my 16 years of using credit, I have never paid anything late EVER.",Customer Service

"In XX/XX/2018 I had water damage to my home XXXX one year ago ). Chase holds the mortgage. The insurance company has paid out to repair the damage, but Chase refuses to release funds. I've now paid for much of my contractor, flooring, countertops, etc and Chase refuses to release funds. I'm approximately {$40000.00} out of pocket while Chase holds approximately {$150000.00} of my insurance money in escrow. 

I've uploaded every document they've asked for, many of the documents multiple times. Sometimes, like on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told a check was coming for {$75000.00}. Then an hour later someone called from Chase and said they needed one more thing XXXX a signed contractor agreement because they couldn't read the signature ). I instantly uploaded what they asked for. Today, I called them and the first person said they would be paying as they had everything they needed, but we got disconnected when I wanted to ask about timing. I called back, waited on hold, and the new person told me they needed that same document but now with two signatures.

"On XX/XX/2019 I received a notice from JPM Chase Bank dated XX/XX/2019 in regard to my Chase XXXX Credit Card Account. In the letter, Chase notified me that due to a recent review of my XXXX  credit report, they have opted to reduce my credit line by approximately 40 %. This change put me in a position in which my card is maxed out compared to my balance and reduced my overall available revolving credit amount, causing further damage to my credit history and score. 

I have always paid my card on time and Chase has increased my credit line twice in the past. I was shocked to receive this notice and even more surprised that Chase was completely unwilling to compromise. 

A credit card company 's solution for less than optimal credit should not be to cause further harm to a consumer 's credit history.

I received a Chase Auto Loan for a new car in 2012. I set the account up for automatic deductions from my bank account. These went like clockwork for five years. When the last payment was due Chase sent me a letter asking for a check with a specific amount that would pay off the loan. I sent them the check. When I looked at my checking account statement I saw that they processed my check and subsequently made an extra automatic deduction that they did n't deserve for a Paid-in-full loan. Apparently Chase is n't able to discern when it has been paid-in-full and will keep helping itself from your checking account until you go into Chase.com and stop them. When I tried to go into Chase.com the system would n't recognize me - probably because my loan was paid-in-full and thus my account was closed. This is the perfect feedback loop. You pay them in full but you ca n't get in to stop the payments because your account is paid in full. After about an hour I was able to get to someone with the technical ability to stop the payments. Now Chase is sitting on {$620.00} that belongs to me. I will be pleasantly surprised if I ever get it back.,Loans
"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text alert for my Chase Freedom card in the amount of {$650.00} that I hadn't authorized or purchased. I called Chase immediately to report this as fraud ; they removed the charge. I wasn't aware what the purchase was for until 3 days later when I was looking at my XXXX  purchase history and found "" hidden '' purchases as an option ( until now I didn't even know this was an option on XXXX ). I found a "" hidden '' purchase for a XXXX/XXXX purchase for three auto air compressors that were being shipped to my home address attached to my XXXX account. The hacker had successfully used my XXXX account, but were not able to change the delivery address. Since I had already reported this to Chase and the charge had been removed from my online statement, I thought it was settled so I contacted the XXXX seller, XXXX, and explained the situation ; asking them if they could send me a shipping label to send the order back to them once it was received at my home ( I didn't want to be accepting stolen goods ). The XXXX contact admitted in their first reply to me that they had seen an increase in fraudulent orders and accommodated the shipping label request to have the items returned to them. The seller received their items back within a week of the original fraudulent order and well within their noted 30 day return policy timeframe. The following month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I noticed that the {$680.00} was showing up again on my online activity on the Chase website. I contacted Chase again and they said they had confirmed the order had been delivered to my home so they would not agree to covering it as fraud. I explained to them that I had documentation proving I returned the items when I learned they were shipping the items to me since the hacker was not able to successfully change the shipping address attached to my XXXX account on the XXXX order. The re-opened the investigation and I sent them all the message exchanges between me and the XXXX seller, XXXX. 

I was notified XX/XX/XXXX that Chase had once again closed the investigation and refused to cover it as a fraudulent purchase. They also reported this as a dispute to the three credit agencies. I called the contact 's name listed on their letter they sent to learn why they refused this as fraud. I left a voicemail and in the meantime I contacted Chase Support via XXXX. They DM 'd me and reviewed some details, but refused to provide assistance since this had already been looked at by the investigation unit and charged back to the account by Chase. 

I contacted the XXXX  seller XX/XX/XXXX and explained the credit card company was not going to cover this fraudulent order and so I requested my funds be returned since they received the items within their XXXX  return policy. They refused to return the funds stating it's been beyond 30 days of the order and claimed they no longer have the ability. They asked if I had contacted XXXX. I told them I was going to report it to both XXXX and XXXX, but htat they should do the right thing and negotiate a refund since they got their merchandise back while they accepted stolen funds, even while admitting they had seen increased fraudulent activity. I contacted XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX refused to open an investigation because I reported the issue to Chase first and they claim once the credit card is notified, they are no longer responsible for fraudulent orders. I also called XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX and they refused to assist because 60 days had already passed and I didn't report it to them immediately ; also since XXXX was refusing to assist, they said they were no longer obligated to help. They set me up with a dual-certification sign-in option for my account to protect from future fraudulent orders on my account. XXXX  advised me to try to work with the seller directly. I have not gotten a response from the XXXX seller since XX/XX/XXXX after I sent them two messages that day via the XXXX message service. 

I received a callback from Chase XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX in Chase 's investigation unit. She said although they believed me that this was not an authorized purchase and that it was outside my normal purchase history, they were unable to find a window in their policy that would allow them to cover it as fraud because it had been delivered to my home. She advised me to try to work with the dispute department claiming they would be able to work with the XXXX seller on my behalf to recoup the funds, so she transferred me to the dispute department. At the time, I didn't realize this was just a de-escalation transfer and that dispute department would offer no assistance in all actuality. I spoke to two different people, an agent and a supervisor ( I can not recall their names, XXXX and XXXX if I had a guess ). They refused to re-open the dispute case since Chase had already investigated it and charged the {$650.00} back to the account. They said that since this was no longer charged on the account from XXXX seller and actually Chase, that this prohibited their ability to contact the seller on my behalf. They only offered me a mailing address to request an escalation of the issue to request further support. This hand-off between the investigation unit and the dispute department seems to be a shady business practice since the investigation unit should already know that the dispute department can not help a customer if the bank were the ones re-applying the charges, and not the seller/store. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing ; or at least are willfully ignorant to their own inter-departmental policies. 

Now, I am left owing {$650.00} to Chase and they are refusing to work with the seller on my behalf to recoup the stolen funds from the XXXX seller who has accepted the stolen funds and the returned merchandise after they admitted to increased fraudulent order activity. 

I've learned a valuable lesson to not contact the credit card company first, and rather contact XXXX first and report the seller to XXXX  immediately, but my first instinct was to contact the bank once I received the transaction alert. People should be aware of this process as it seems like an easy-out for XXXX to take any responsibility from covering fraud and XXXX  to assist with poor seller business practices.",Client Communication

"This situation involves a XXXX painting company what I hired last XXXX ( XXXX ) to do some interior painting in my home, and a disputed amount of {$1600.00} that they charged on my credit card without my permission, and without finishing the job. I am in a dispute with Chase, who has messaged me that they are ruling in favor of the painting company ... who in my opinion very clearly committed fraud. I agreed to have the company take a 1/3 payment for the job through my credit card. After the company worked in my home for 1-1/2 days, I let them go ( it was Chase 's suggestion that I do this, as I had a conversation with one of their representatives over the phone ) ... due to issues that were unresolved with regard to quality of work and professional behavior of painters. Unfortunately I forgot to call my credit card company to protect me, and the very next day after I let them go via email, the painting company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) charged my card for the full remaining 2/3 of the original job ( on XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$1600.00} ) ... even though a large portion of the job was not complete, and I never signed off and gave them permission to charge anything. The company made NO attempt to settle this situation, and I took their action of charging my account without my permission as a clear message that they were not willing to satisfy me in any way. 

After providing Chase with multiple photos, a receipt from another independent painter that I hired to fix the poor work, and complete the work that was never done, as well as a letter from the same painter stating his view of the situation ( which Chase requested of me ), I received a letter from Chase that they were still not changing their decision to rule in favor of the painting company. 

I have no reason to lie about any of this, and I have excellent credit and no history of any other disputes ( other than a vacation package scam ). I have no criminal record, and have never been in trouble with the law. I am only guilty of being very upset over the phone when the Chase has been difficult to deal with. But being upset over the phone in no way makes me a liar, or someone who is trying to get out of paying their bills. In this case, the painting company clearly committed fraud, and Chase does not seem to care. It appears that the painting company has dealt with complaints before, and maybe has a lawyer who is threatening them.

"This complaint is regarding a mortgage for a property I purchased in XXXX XXXX. I had several mortgage transfers during the life of the loan and all and gone smoothly until Chase Bank acquired my loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. had owned my loan through XXXX XXXX. I had been set up with By weekly automatic payments of XXXX. The mortgage was for a property in Arizona and the statements were being mailed to my secondary address in XXXX TN as I was based in XXXX XXXX and had most of my mail transferred there for convenience. I had no delinquencies on the mortgage. Everything was automatic as far as the payments and escrow was concerned. 

My loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on XXXX XXXX, XXXX unbeknownst to me and no effort was made to inform me of this transfer except by mail to the secondary address. Later, in XXXX, I was informed by XXXX, XXXX, via email, that they had taken over collections of my loan payments from Chase. This was the first I had heard that my loan was no longer with XXXX. I contacted XXXX and found out that in fact Chase had purchased my loan and had me shown as delinquent for three months. I immediately contacted Chase and asked why I had not been informed and why they had not taken reasonable effort to contact me about the loan transfer. XXXX obviously acquired my information from them and was able to contact me about my loan transfer. I was upset about the fact that Chase was unable to do the same! 

Chase reported late payments for the months of XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They were, in fact, not received because I had no idea the loan had been transferred much less to whom. Chase had all of my contact information including email and phone number but made no attempt to reach me. XXXX did a great job informing me of the changes in my loan and therefore, I was able to bring my payments up to date as soon as the transfer happened. In light of this situation, I had contacted Chase Credit research department to investigate and to remove the report to the credit agencies as they were the ones who did not make reasonable effort to contact me about the changes to my loan. I had never been late for the term of the loan until it was purchased by Chase bank and the lack of communication by Chase was the underlying cause. I did not ask for my loan to be transferred and when a financial institution changes the terms of an individuals loan, they should make every effort to communicate those changes to the customer in order to avoid situations such as this. 

The loan was finally brought up to date with a payment draft of XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

I submitted a request to investigate to Chase Bank 's Credit research dept. and they received it around XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XXXX XXXX they replied that they could not update their credit reporting on my behalf. I submitted another request in XXXX of XXXX and informed them of my intentions to file a complaint with this agency if they would not make the situation right by realizing their fault in the matter. In short, they took no action to correct the situation they they had ultimately caused. 

I had had this loan for around 15 years and had never been late! There was no way that I would have intentional let this loan payment be late because of the amount of equity I had built up in the property! ( I only owed around {$45000.00} on a house worth around {$300000.00} XXXX If I had left it up to Chase Bank, the property may have been foreclosed on without my knowing because of their inept communication practices. Again, they had my Phone number and email address ; which was used by XXXX, the organization that acquired the loan from them along with all of my information. 

I hope that Chase is called out for this poor business practice so that other customers are not in the same situation as me.",Loans

Chase Bank seems to believe they have the right to deny financial services to a person because they disagree with their political position on a legal issue. I wonder if a federally chartered bank can deny financial services for that reason. They could not do it for race, ethnicity or religion. Is this a free speech violation of the first amendment for a federally chartered bank to do this? 

I am not the only XXXX to have this happen. XXXX had all its credit card processing accounts closed for the same reason last week. 

The question is why are so many financial institutions doing this as we are doing nothing illegal. Is this their own decision to undermine us or is some backroom power ( law enforcement?

This would increase my mortgage payment by approximately 13 %, from {$3300.00} to {$3700.00}. I explained that this was Chase 's mistake, and I should not be asked to pay an additional {$4000.00} ( or a 13 % increase in mortgage payment ) because of their error.

"This email is in regards to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My XXXX children and I stayed at that location from XXXX2020 through XXXX2020. Throughout the duration of my stay, there were unauthorized transactions that took place on my Chase banking account by this business. I dealt with front desk personnel XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( who I told was fired ), XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. There was one other XXXX female at the front desk but don't remember her name. There was {$160.00} taken from my bank account unauthorized and not sure what it was for. When XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX was asked about it they refused to address it and became disgruntled and argumentative. On the same day they authorized {$240.00} from my account that they weren't supposed to. It was only supposed to be {$200.00}. They blamed it on Chase Bank. Despite, disputing it with my bank after the front desk staff advised it would drop off and didn't, XXXX XXXX still lied to Chase Bank claims department and stated it wasn't an error. 

When I reviewed my account and seen that there were charges that weren't supposed to be on my account, I requested from XXXX XXXX print outstanding of my booking receipts to compare to my reservations. She stalled for an entire day. She gave me a 3 pages one day and the other pages the next. They weren't given all at once. I noticed that XXXX XXXX was running back and forth from the back offices while smirking. XXXX XXXX was in the back giving her the papers to give me. Once I finally reviewed the paperwork they gave me I noticed that they were altered. My reservations would sometimes be for 3 days and within that particular reservation, per the documentation provided to me my rates would increase from day to day. One or the two of them were altering documents to make it appear that they charges were legit when they weren't. They would run my card when I wasn't at the desk or hadn't authorized the transactions. As a result, my account was overdrawn on more than one occasion for more than {$500.00}. There was a transaction for over {$480.00} that I don't recall authorizing. The XXXX owners called my cell phone and threatened me. They came over to the property on XXXX2020 and told me I had to come downstairs to speak with them because of the claims I'd filed with my bank. They both were verbally aggressive. The heavier XXXX repeatedly walked up on me. He even snatched my cellphone and moved it to another location on the table. They didn't care about President Trump 's social distancing policy in place. They even started that they didn't care about XXXX law enforcement. They ordered my XXXX children and I off the premises. 

They have plumbing problems. They also have leaks in their A/C units as well as no air at all in some rooms that they still rent out. Closets are not in and broke. Chairs are completely broke which left a scare on me. I still called XXXX XXXX customer service and gave the location compliments. Once I did that, they were horribly mean.

They stole Reward points and checked others in with my free night vouchers. Even XXXX told me that I should've received my monies back from the claims I filed, but XXXX XXXX consistently lies. He was the one who ran the {$240.00} transaction when it was only supposed to be for {$200.00}.
